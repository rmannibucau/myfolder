= MyFolder

== How to dev

=== Java

Java is used with a plain Meecrowave (JAX-RS/CDI) for the backend

To start a server:

[source]
----
mvn process-classes meecrowave:run
----

=== Frontend

Frontend is an Angular 2 application, to watch (continously update) the front use:

[source]
----
# run once
mvn frontend:npm@npm-install
# watch
mvn frontend:npm@dev
----

=== Build

The build will package the application as a jar and create a runner version:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
cd target && \
  java -jar myfolder-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----

Then just hit http://localhost:8080

Note: by default application uses `~/.myfolder` but you can change it on the command line:

[source]
----
java -jar myfolder-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar --myfolder-folder=$HOME
----
